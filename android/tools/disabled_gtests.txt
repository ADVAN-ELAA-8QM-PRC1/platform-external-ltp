# disabled_gtests.txt: list of tests which build but shouldn't be part of a
# normal test run

# alarm02 tests for a boundary condition which is impractical to implement
# correctly on 32-bit Linux.  bionic deliberately breaks with POSIX by reporting
# that it failed to set up the alarm.  (Other libc implementations fail to
# set up the alarm too, but then return 0 anyway.)
alarm02

# readdir02 calls opendir() -> closedir() -> readdir() and checks if readdir()
# returns EBADF.  POSIX doesn't require this, and bionic is likely to instead
# deadlock trying to acquire a destroyed mutex.
readdir02

# Android sets RLIMIT_NICE to 40, so setpriority02 succeeds unexpectedly
setpriority02

# fork13 takes ~45 minutes to run
fork13

# open13 tests that fchmod() fails on fds opened with O_PATH.  bionic
# deliberately masks the EBADF returned by the kernel.
